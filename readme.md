# L.O.R.S.
L.O.R.S. is a loot heavy, open world, roguelike survival game with procedurally generated lore. It was written in C#, and based on the thorough and insanely helpful [RogueSharp tutorial](https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/roguesharp-v3-tutorial-introduction-and-goals/).

## Basic Concept
The concept of the game is to interact with the lore enough to uncover all of the (procedurally generated) main quests, beat them, and become the hero of the world. You will need to survive by eating, drinking, and sleeping. You will collect procedurally generated weapons and fight (sometimes unique) procedurally generated monsters.

## Gameplay
The user will open the game, and create a hero. The player will then interact with the procedurally generated 2d world with a real-time combat system (based on scheduling & speed), crafting, creating art (such as music or stories), and farming.
